**smartcommute** - live traffic and weather report, useful for commuter details!

**circularlist** - fun with circular linked lists.

**pubmedsearch** - easy searching for your favorite scientific topics on pubmed

**automate_cv_analysis** - script for my lab to automate the traversal of fscv files in tar_heel.exe

**delete_scans** - another script for roesch lab to automate the deletion of unneccesary DIO files that get produced when converting raw fscv to dio files.

**medpc_excel_truncate** - yet another script for lab. matlab only allows excel files which have equal length columns. MedPC files have different length columns and sometimes, those extra rows just take up memory. This script truncates those files and pads all the other columns with zeros to make matlab happy!
